## Codes for McNemar tests

- cw = within habitat/buffer under current conditions; co = outside habitat/buffer under current conditions; pw = within habitat/buffer under projected future conditions; po â€“ outside habitat/buffer under projected future conditions

## General McNemar Format

```{r, error = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
OwlSpecies <- matrix(c(cw,co,pw,po),
              nrow = 2,
              dimnames = list("Current" = c("Within", "Outside"), "Projected" = c("Within", "Outside")))

mcnemar.test(OwlSpecies)

```
